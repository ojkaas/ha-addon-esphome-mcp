## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-20 (glibc fork)

### Changed

- Rebased the image on the official `ghcr.io/esphome/esphome` (Debian/glibc)
  image. The previous Alpine/musl base could not run ESPHome's glibc ESP
  cross-toolchains (`xtensa-lx106-elf-g++`), so every compile failed with
  `not found` (exit 127). Compiles/flashes now work.
- Replaced bashio/`with-contenv` startup with a plain `/data/options.json`
  read; cleared the base image's inherited `ENTRYPOINT` and `HEALTHCHECK`
  (the dashboard healthcheck caused a ~60s restart loop).
- Default port moved to **8098** so the fork can run beside the original.

### Added

- Background builds: `esphome_compile` / `esphome_flash` run in a thread and
  return a pollable handle for long builds, with new `esphome_build_status`
  to check progress — avoids MCP request timeouts on multi-minute compiles.
- `esphome_flash` forces OTA (`--device <name>.local`) so it no longer hangs
  on the interactive serial/OTA chooser when USB adapters are present.
